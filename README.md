Project Name: personal-website Tech Stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Vercel Serverless Functions.

About: This project is a comprehensive personal portfolio designed to bridge the gap between "English Literature & Computational Science". It serves as a dynamic resume and showcase for an individual with a dual background in humanities and high-performance computing.

Architecture: The application is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React and Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, academic aesthetic featuring "Oxford Blue" and Slate tones.

Dynamic Integrations: unlike static portfolios, this site actively fetches live data:

GitHub Repos: Fetches the latest public repositories and contribution stats via the GitHub API.

Wikipedia Contributions: Retrieves recent edit history directly from the Wikipedia API to showcase volunteer activity.

Academic Publications: Uses a custom serverless API route (/api/papers) to fetch and display research papers from the Knowledge Commons repository.

Content Sections: The site is modularized into sections including "The Builder" (coding projects), "The Scholar" (research & policy), "Journalism" (articles), and "Leadership" (UN IGF & Orchestra roles).
